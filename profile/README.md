## 🔍 Research Focus

Our research lies at the intersection of **software engineering**, **distributed systems**, and **artificial intelligence**, with particular emphasis on:

- Observability, explainability, and monitoring of microservices
- AI-assisted software engineering (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs)
- Adaptive and data-driven DevOps and MLOps
- Software architecture comprehension and evolution
- Reproducible and sustainable research software

We aim to bridge **theory and practice**, producing artifacts that are both scientifically rigorous and practically impactful.

## 📦 Repository Organization

Our GitHub organization is structured to support long-term, multi-project research:

- `proj-*` – Active research projects
- `tool-*` – Reusable research tools and infrastructure
- `data-*` – Curated datasets and benchmarks
- `paper-*` – Paper artifacts and replication packages
- `tmpl-*` – Repository and documentation templates
- `arch-*` – Archived or completed projects

Each repository follows a standardized structure to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and sustainability.

## 🧪 Open Science & Reproducibility

Whenever possible, our work is:
- Open-source
- Artifact-evaluated
- Reproducible by design

Repositories include documentation, experiment scripts, and citation metadata to support reuse and verification.

---
